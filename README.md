# PolyGCL_New
 POLYGCL utilizes polynomials with learnable filters  to generate different spectral views and an objective that incorporates high-pass  information through a linear combination. We theoretically prove that POLYGCL  outperforms previous GCL paradigms when applied to graphs with varying levels  of homophily.
