# PolyGCL_New
 POLYGCL utilizes polynomials with learnable filters  to generate different spectral views and an objective that incorporates high-pass  information through a linear combination. We theoretically prove that POLYGCL  outperforms previous GCL paradigms when applied to graphs with varying levels  of homophily.

 **Environment Settings:-**
 pytorch 1.11.0

torch-geometric 1.7.2
dgl-cu113 0.8.2
scipy 1.7.1
seaborn 0.11.2
scikit-learn 0.24.2

**Reproduce the results**
You can run the following commands directly.
sh exp_PolyGCL.sh
